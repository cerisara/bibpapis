abstract: A new modification of the Neural Additive Model (NAM) called SurvNAM and
  its modifications are proposed to explain predictions of the black-box machine learning
  survival model. The method is based on applying the original NAM to solving the
  explanation problem in the framework of survival analysis. The basic idea behind
  SurvNAM is to train the network by means of a specific expected loss function which
  takes into account peculiarities of the survival model predictions and is based
  on approximating the black-box model by the extension of the Cox proportional hazards
  model which uses the well-known Generalized Additive Model (GAM) in place of the
  simple linear relationship of covariates. The proposed method SurvNAM allows performing
  the local and global explanation. A set of examples around the explained example
  is randomly generated for the local explanation. The global explanation uses the
  whole training dataset. The proposed modifications of SurvNAM are based on using
  the Lasso-based regularization for functions from GAM and for a special representation
  of the GAM functions using their weighted linear and non-linear parts, which is
  implemented as a shortcut connection. A lot of numerical experiments illustrate
  the SurvNAM efficiency.
