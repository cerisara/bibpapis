abstract: Roguelike games generally feature exploration problems as a critical, yet
  often repetitive element of gameplay. Automated approaches, however, face challenges
  in terms of optimality, as well as due to incomplete information, such as from the
  presence of secret doors. This paper presents an algorithmic approach to exploration
  of roguelike dungeon environments. Our design aims to minimize exploration time,
  balancing coverage and discovery of secret areas with resource cost. Our algorithm
  is based on the concept of occupancy maps popular in robotics, adapted to encourage
  efficient discovery of secret access points. Through extensive experimentation on
  NetHack maps we show that this technique is significantly more efficient than simpler
  greedy approaches and an existing automated player. We further investigate optimized
  parameterization for the algorithm through a comprehensive data analysis. These
  results point towards better automation for players as well as heuristics applicable
  to fully automated gameplay.
