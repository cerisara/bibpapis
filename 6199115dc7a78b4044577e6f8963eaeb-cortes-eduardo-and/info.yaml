abstract: 'Question classification is an important component of Question Answering
  Systems responsible for identifying the type of an answer a particular question
  requires. For instance, {``}Who is the prime minister of the United Kingdom?{''''}
  demands a name of a PERSON, while {``}When was the queen of the United Kingdom born?{''''}
  entails a DATE. This work makes an extensible review of the most recent methods
  for Question Classification, taking into consideration their applicability in low-resourced
  languages. First, we propose a manual classification of the current state-of-the-art
  methods in four distinct categories: low, medium, high, and very high level of dependency
  on external resources. Second, we applied this categorization in an empirical comparison
  in terms of the amount of data necessary for training and performance in different
  languages. In addition to complementing earlier works in this field, our study shows
  a boost on methods relying on recent language models, overcoming methods not suitable
  for low-resourced languages.'
