abstract: The memorization effect of deep neural network (DNN) plays a pivotal role
  in many state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods. To exploit this property,
  the early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of training,
  is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early stopping point by
  considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be considered as a composition
  of a series of layers, and we find that the latter layers in a DNN are much more
  sensitive to label noise, while their former counterparts are quite robust. Therefore,
  selecting a stopping point for the whole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically
  affected each other, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose
  to separate a DNN into different parts and progressively train them to address this
  problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole DNN all at once, we
  initially train former DNN layers by optimizing the DNN with a relatively large
  number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the latter DNN layers
  by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers fixed to counteract
  the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as progressive early stopping
  (PES). Despite its simplicity, compared with the early stopping, PES can help to
  obtain more promising and stable results. Furthermore, by combining PES with existing
  approaches on noisy label training, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on image
  classification benchmarks.
