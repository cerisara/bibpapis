abstract: Today we live in a context in which devices are increasingly interconnected
  and sensorized and are almost ubiquitous. Deep learning has become in recent years
  a popular way to extract knowledge from the huge amount of data that these devices
  are able to collect. Nevertheless, centralized state-of-the-art learning methods
  have a number of drawbacks when facing real distributed problems, in which the available
  information is usually private, partial, biased and evolving over time. Federated
  learning is a popular framework that allows multiple distributed devices to train
  models remotely, collaboratively, and preserving data privacy. However, the current
  proposals in federated learning focus on deep architectures that in many cases are
  not feasible to implement in non-dedicated devices such as smartphones. Also, little
  research has been done regarding the scenario where data distribution changes over
  time in unforeseen ways, causing what is known as concept drift. Therefore, in this
  work we want to present Light Federated and Continual Consensus (LFedCon2), a new
  federated and continual architecture that uses light, traditional learners. Our
  method allows powerless devices (such as smartphones or robots) to learn in real
  time, locally, continuously, autonomously and from users, but also improving models
  globally, in the cloud, combining what is learned locally, in the devices. In order
  to test our proposal, we have applied it in a heterogeneous community of smartphone
  users to solve the problem of walking recognition. The results show the advantages
  that LFedCon2 provides with respect to other state-of-the-art methods.
