abstract: Image narrative generation is a task to create a story from an image with
  a subjective viewpoint. Given the importance of the subjective feelings of writers,
  readers, and characters in storytelling, an image narrative generation method should
  consider human emotion. In this study, we propose a novel method of image narrative
  generation called ViNTER (Visual Narrative Transformer with Emotion arc Representation),
  which takes "emotion arc" as input to capture a sequence of emotional changes. Since
  emotion arcs represent the trajectory of emotional change, it is expected that we
  can include detailed information about the emotional changes in the story to the
  model. We present experimental results of both automatic and manual evaluations
  on the Image Narrative dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  approach.
