abstract: Machine learning can be enhanced through the integration of external knowledge.
  This method, called knowledge informed machine learning, is also applicable within
  the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). In this paper, the various
  methods of knowledge informed machine learning, from a PHM context, are reviewed
  with the goal of helping the reader understand the domain. In addition, a knowledge
  informed machine learning technique is demonstrated, using the common IMS and PRONOSTIA
  bearing data sets, for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Specifically, knowledge
  is garnered from the field of reliability engineering which is represented through
  the Weibull distribution. The knowledge is then integrated into a neural network
  through a novel Weibull-based loss function. A thorough statistical analysis of
  the Weibull-based loss function is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of
  the method on the PRONOSTIA data set. However, the Weibull-based loss function is
  less effective on the IMS data set. The results, shortcomings, and benefits of the
  approach are discussed in length. Finally, all the code is publicly available for
  the benefit of other researchers.
