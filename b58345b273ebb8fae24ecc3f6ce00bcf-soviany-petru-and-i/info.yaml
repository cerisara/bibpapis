abstract: Training machine learning models in a meaningful order, from the easy samples
  to the hard ones, using curriculum learning can provide performance improvements
  over the standard training approach based on random data shuffling, without any
  additional computational costs. Curriculum learning strategies have been successfully
  employed in all areas of machine learning, in a wide range of tasks. However, the
  necessity of finding a way to rank the samples from easy to hard, as well as the
  right pacing function for introducing more difficult data can limit the usage of
  the curriculum approaches. In this survey, we show how these limits have been tackled
  in the literature, and we present different curriculum learning instantiations for
  various tasks in machine learning. We construct a multi-perspective taxonomy of
  curriculum learning approaches by hand, considering various classification criteria.
  We further build a hierarchical tree of curriculum learning methods using an agglomerative
  clustering algorithm, linking the discovered clusters with our taxonomy. At the
  end, we provide some interesting directions for future work.
