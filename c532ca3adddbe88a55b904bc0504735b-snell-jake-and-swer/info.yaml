abstract: We propose prototypical networks for the problem of few-shot classification,
  where a classifier must generalize to new classes not seen in the training set,
  given only a small number of examples of each new class. Prototypical networks learn
  a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to
  prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent approaches for few-shot
  learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data
  regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some
  simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches
  involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning. We further extend
  prototypical networks to zero-shot learning and achieve state-of-the-art results
  on the CU-Birds dataset.
