abstract: Federated learning holds great promise in learning from fragmented sensitive
  data and has revolutionized how machine learning models are trained. This article
  provides a systematic overview and detailed taxonomy of federated learning. We investigate
  the existing security challenges in federated learning and provide a comprehensive
  overview of established defense techniques for data poisoning, inference attacks,
  and model poisoning attacks. The work also presents an overview of current training
  challenges for federated learning, focusing on handling non-i.i.d. data, high dimensionality
  issues, and heterogeneous architecture, and discusses several solutions for the
  associated challenges. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in managing
  federated learning training and suggest focused research directions to address the
  open questions. Potential candidate areas for federated learning, including IoT
  ecosystem, healthcare applications, are discussed with a particular focus on banking
  and financial domains.
