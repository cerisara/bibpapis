abstract: Transformers have achieved superior performances in many tasks in natural
  language processing and computer vision, which also intrigues great interests in
  the time series community. Among multiple advantages of transformers, the ability
  to capture long-range dependencies and interactions is especially attractive for
  time series modeling, leading to exciting progress in various time series applications.
  In this paper, we systematically review transformer schemes for time series modeling
  by highlighting their strengths as well as limitations through a new taxonomy to
  summarize existing time series transformers in two perspectives. From the perspective
  of network modifications, we summarize the adaptations of module level and architecture
  level of the time series transformers. From the perspective of applications, we
  categorize time series transformers based on common tasks including forecasting,
  anomaly detection, and classification. Empirically, we perform robust analysis,
  model size analysis, and seasonal-trend decomposition analysis to study how Transformers
  perform in time series. Finally, we discuss and suggest future directions to provide
  useful research guidance. A corresponding resource list that will be continuously
  updated can be found in the GitHub repository. To the best of our knowledge, this
  paper is the first work to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent
  advances of Transformers for modeling time series data. We hope this survey will
  ignite further research interests in time series Transformers.
