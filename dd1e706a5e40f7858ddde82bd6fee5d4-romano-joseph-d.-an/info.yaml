abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) and deep learning (DL) are two cutting-edge
  paradigms used to solve a myriad of inductive learning tasks. In spite of their
  successes, little guidance exists for when to choose one approach over the other
  in the context of specific real-world problems. Furthermore, relatively few tools
  exist that allow the integration of both AutoML and DL in the same analysis to yield
  results combining both of their strengths. Here, we seek to address both of these
  issues, by (1.) providing a head-to-head comparison of AutoML and DL in the context
  of binary classification on 6 well-characterized public datasets, and (2.) evaluating
  a new tool for genetic programming-based AutoML that incorporates deep estimators.
  Our observations suggest that AutoML outperforms simple DL classifiers when trained
  on similar datasets for binary classification but integrating DL into AutoML improves
  classification performance even further. However, the substantial time needed to
  train AutoML+DL pipelines will likely outweigh performance advantages in many applications.
