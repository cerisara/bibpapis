abstract: Time is an important feature in many applications involving events that
  occur synchronously and/or asynchronously. To effectively consume time information,
  recent studies have focused on designing new architectures. In this paper, we take
  an orthogonal but complementary approach by providing a model-agnostic vector representation
  for time, called Time2Vec, that can be easily imported into many existing and future
  architectures and improve their performances. We show on a range of models and problems
  that replacing the notion of time with its Time2Vec representation improves the
  performance of the final model.
