abstract: We introduce Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), a learning paradigm to estimate
  invariant correlations across multiple training distributions. To achieve this goal,
  IRM learns a data representation such that the optimal classifier, on top of that
  data representation, matches for all training distributions. Through theory and
  experiments, we show how the invariances learned by IRM relate to the causal structures
  governing the data and enable out-of-distribution generalization.
