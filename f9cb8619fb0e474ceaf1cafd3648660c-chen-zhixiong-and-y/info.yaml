abstract: 'The limited communication resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy, and data
  heterogeneity across devices are two of the main bottlenecks for federated learning
  (FL). To tackle these challenges, we first devise a novel FL framework with partial
  model aggregation (PMA), which only aggregates the lower layers of neural networks
  responsible for feature extraction while the upper layers corresponding to complex
  pattern recognition remain at devices for personalization. The proposed PMA-FL is
  able to address the data heterogeneity and reduce the transmitted information in
  wireless channels. We then obtain a convergence bound of the framework under a non-convex
  loss function setting. With the aid of this bound, we define a new objective function,
  named the scheduled data sample volume, to transfer the original inexplicit optimization
  problem into a tractable one for device scheduling, bandwidth allocation, computation
  and communication time division. Our analysis reveals that the optimal time division
  is achieved when the communication and computation parts of PMA-FL have the same
  power. We also develop a bisection method to solve the optimal bandwidth allocation
  policy and use the set expansion algorithm to address the optimal device scheduling.
  Compared with the state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed PMA-FL improves 2.72%
  and 11.6% accuracy on two typical heterogeneous datasets, i.e., MINIST and CIFAR-10,
  respectively. In addition, the proposed joint dynamic device scheduling and resource
  optimization approach achieve slightly higher accuracy than the considered benchmarks,
  but they provide a satisfactory energy and time reduction: 29% energy or 20% time
  reduction on the MNIST; and 25% energy or 12.5% time reduction on the CIFAR-10.'
